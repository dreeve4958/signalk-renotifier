## System requirements

__signalk-renotifier__ has no special system requirements that must be met
prior to installation.

Since this plugin's purpose is simply to distribute Signal K notifications, the
Signal K server must be issuing notifications relating to the values you wish
to monitor.
There are a number of general purpose notification plugins available in the
Signal K appstore which may satisfy this requirement.
