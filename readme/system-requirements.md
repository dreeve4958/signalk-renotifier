## System requirements

__signalk-renotifier__ has no special system requirements that must be met
prior to installation.

For the plugin to operate notifications must be being raised on the host
Signal K server: there are a number of notification plugins available in the
Signal K appstore. 

Of course, for the plugin to actually _do_ anything it requires one or more
scripts which implement the actual renotification function.
Two such specimen scripts are included with the distribution which provide
cellular network messaging and email connectivity.
Both of these have their own requirements for supporting hardware and
infrastructure.
