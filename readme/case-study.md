## Case study

Sending an SMS from a computer requires that the system has access to a
cellular modem (or a mobile phone that supports remote control) and a software
stack that can make this hardware operate in a meaningful way.

The hardware on _Beatrice_ consists of a Huawei E353 USB cellular modem
connected to a spare port on the Signal K Node server host.
The modem was purchased on Ebay for a few Euros and is connected to a
(probably unnecessary) external antenna (purchased from a chandler for
many tens of Euros).

The software I use to access my cellular modem is
[Gammu](https://wammu.eu/gammu/)
which is part of most modern Linux distributions and can be installed using
the system's package manager.
