# signalk-renotifier

[Signal K Node server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node)
plugin which executes arbitrary external _notification scripts_ in response to
system notifications.

The plugin was developed to provide a remote notification service and although
this functional role determines the syntax of external script invocation it
does not place arbitrary constraints on what a script can do.

This distribution includes scripts which support distributing notifications by
email and SMS.
